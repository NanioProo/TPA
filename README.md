# 🎯 Trajectory Program Analyzer (TPA)

**TPA** is a lightweight and flexible tool for simulating and analyzing 2D projectile motion. It calculates the path of an object in flight based on physics inputs like initial velocity, launch angle, gravity, and time.

Whether you're a student, developer, or just curious about how trajectories work, TPA offers a clear and customizable way to experiment with projectile motion.
