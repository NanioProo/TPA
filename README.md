ðŸ“Œ Trajectory Program Analyzer (TPA)
TPA is a lightweight and efficient tool designed to simulate and analyze projectile motion in 2D space. It calculates trajectory paths based on initial velocity, angle, gravity, and time, providing a clear visualization or output of the motion. Perfect for physics learners, game developers, or anyone exploring kinematics.
